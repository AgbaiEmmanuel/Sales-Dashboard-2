# Sales Dashboard 2
Quantum analytics sales dashboard done with Microsoft Excel


Same Quantum Analytics sales data I used in making the previous repository, but over here I gave a whole lot of different insights still using the Microsoft Excel to achieve my goal.

The various insights that I generated from the data to create this sales dashboards includes:

*Total quantity of 1,430 cut across 342 number of different products manufactured by 13 different manufacturers raised a total revenue of $9,826,183 in six months (January to June).

* The highest amount of revenue was generated in the month of March and April ($2.2M) each.

* Out of 5 states, 38% of the revenue came from Ontario while 36% came from Alberta.

* $8.5M revenue was generated only from the urban category.

* Most quantity of the products were sold on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

* Maximus UM-43 product generated the highest revenue ($574K) while Currus RP-34 generated the least revenue of $944.
